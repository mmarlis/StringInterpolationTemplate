# StringInterpolationTemplate

This project is used to demonstrate the git Workflow Action and, specifically, the use of StringInterpolation

A7 - String Interpolation Tests


* Use the StringInterpolationTemplateLinks to an external site. as a basis for this assignment.

In case it wasn't clear, use the var date = _date.Now value in your code so it will be overridden by the tests.  See the Number01() method as an example if you are unsure.

This assignment will mirror the previously assigned String Interpolation exercise.  Please see that assignment for details.

This assignment extends that one by adding unit tests as a requirement.  Note that this will also be using the GitHub WorkflowLinks to an external site. that has been setup as part of the template provided. 

Requirements

You will use your previous submission, and format the code to conform with the unit testing template, as discussed in class.  

1.You will write one additional item to output the year (2022) as a hexidecimal valueLinks to an external site..  This will require,
   1. A new method defined in the interface (probably called "Number11")
   2. A new concrete implementation of that method
2. You will write an associated test,
   1. Write a new unit test that should pass once submitted.
